   server. From the Nagios homepage: Allows you to execute "local"
   plugins (like check_disk, check_procs, etc.) on remote hosts. The
   check_nrpe plugin is called from Nagios and actually makes the
   plugin requests to the remote host. Requires that nrpe be running on
   the remote host (either as a standalone daemon or as a service under
   inetd).

-  **ntopNG** - ntopng (replaces ntop) is a network probe that shows
   network usage in a way similar to what top does for processes. In
   interactive mode, it displays the network status on the user's
   terminal. In Web mode it acts as a Web server, creating an HTML dump
   of the network status. It sports a NetFlow/sFlow emitter/collector,
   an HTTP-based client interface for creating ntop-centric monitoring
   applications, and RRD for persistently storing traffic statistics.

-  :doc:`NUT <nut-package>` - Network UPS Tools provides support for monitoring of

   is flow-based network traffic analyser capable of Cisco NetFlow data export.
   Softflowd semi-statefully tracks traffic flows recorded by listening on a
   network interface or by reading a packet capture file. These flows may be
   reported via NetFlow to a collecting host or summarised within softflowd
   itself. Softflowd supports Netflow versions 1, 5 and 9 and is fully
   IPv6-capable - it can track IPv6 flows and send export datagrams via
   IPv6. It also supports export to multicast groups, allowing for
   redundant flow collectors.

-  :doc:`Status Traffic Totals <vnstat>` - Traffic Totals page under the Status
   menu, which will give a total amount of traffic passed In/Out over
   the period of hours, days, and months. Uses vnStat for data
   collection.

   maintain custom system patches.

-  **Squid** - High performance web proxy cache (3.5 branch). It
   combines Squid as a proxy server with its capabilities of acting as a

   Assistant, SSL filtering and antivirus integration via C-ICAP.

-  :doc:`SquidGuard </cache-proxy/squidguard-package>` - High performance web
   proxy URL filter.

-  **TFTPD** - tftpd installs and runs a TFTP server. We use the
   versatile tftp-hpa server.

-  **Tinc** - tinc is a Virtual Private Network (VPN) daemon that uses
   tunnelling and encryption to create a secure private network between
   hosts on the Internet. Because the tunnel appears to the IP level
   network code as a normal network device, there is no need to adapt
   any existing software. This tunnelling allows VPN sites to share
   information with each other over the Internet without exposing any
   information to others. A single tinc daemon can accept more than one
   connection at a time, thus making it possible to create larger
   virtual networks, because some limitations are circumvented. Instead
   of most other VPN implementations, tinc encapsulates each network
   packet in its own UDP packet, instead of encapsulating all into one
   TCP or even PPP over TCP stream. This results in lower latencies,
   less overhead, and in general better responsiveness and throughput.

-  **Zabbix-agent** - LTS (Long Term Support) release of Zabbix
   Monitoring agent. Zabbix LTS releases are supported for Zabbix
   customers during five (5) years i.e. 3 years of Full Support
   (general, critical and security issues) and 2 additional years of
   Limited Support (critical and security issues only). Zabbix LTS
   version release will result in change of the first version number.

-  **Zabbix-proxy** - LTS (Long Term Support) release of Zabbix Agent
   proxy. Zabbix LTS releases are supported for Zabbix customers during
   five (5) years i.e. 3 years of Full Support (general, critical and
   security issues) and 2 additional years of Limited Support (critical
   and security issues only). Zabbix LTS version release will result in
   change of the first version number.
